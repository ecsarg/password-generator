* Prompts user to select a password length between 8 and 128 characters.
* Prompts user to select at least one character type including lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
* If user incorrectly enter for length prompt or does not select a character type, then recalled function to beginning. 
* Generated password then displays in box of HTML page.

## Problem Solving
* Used arrays for character elements
* Utilized "array.prototype.push.apply" to string contructors together to problem solve through characters arrays not being pulled for possibleChoices
* Created for () loop to create randomPassword using Math.floor and Math.radom to multiple by possibleChoice length to apply to correct length entered by user
